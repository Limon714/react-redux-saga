 ## `Why Redux Saga`
     
     Redux Saga is an alternative approach to the organization of side effects. 
     Instead of dispatching functions processed by Redux Thunk 
     you create saga and write all the logic of event stream processing. 
     Unlike thunks that are carried out when you dispatch them, 
     sagas run in the background right after the app is launched.

## `Redux MiddleWare`

    Redux Middleware allows you to 
    intercept every action sent to the 
    reducer so you can make changes to 
    the action or cancel the action.
    Middleware helps you with logging, 
    error reporting, making asynchronous 
    requests, and a whole lot more.
